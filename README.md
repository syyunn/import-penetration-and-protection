  - [Import penetration and the politics of trade protection (Maggia, 2000; 113)](https://sci-hub.st/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002219969900029X)
    - **"Trade protection increases (strictly) with import penetration."**

  - [Protection for Sale: An Empirical Investigation (Maggi, 1997; 1056)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w5942.pdf)
